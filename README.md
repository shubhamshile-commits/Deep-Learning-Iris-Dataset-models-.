# Deep-Learning-Iris-Dataset-models-.
This project builds a deep learning model to classify flowers in the Iris dataset using features like sepal and petal measurements. The workflow includes data preprocessing, training a neural network, and evaluating accuracy. It demonstrates how neural networks learn patterns for multi-class classification on a small dataset.
